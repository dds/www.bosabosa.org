<summary>
Shame is hard to give up, but if you have it, make it a priority to get rid of it.

-   Fuck pride

-   Just be you and own it

-   It's OK to ask for help along the way

How do you feel about yourself? Are you proud? I hope you are a little, because you're the shit. You're reading this, so you've learned to read and had to overcome incredible odds and adversity to do that, and so much more. How proud are you?

Because pride can send you into a dark place, too. Do you think you're better than others? If you sometimes catch yourself thinking, "why can't he just figure it out?" or, "why doesn't she know this already?" then you might be too proud. Since [we all struggle](/posts/we-all-struggle), we don't all get there at the same pace, if at all.
